# This especific file doesn't need to 
# restart. But in either cases (LAN or WAN connection of the NanoPi), you must see it like a wireless router connection under your computer. 
# If this isn't working or it's missing the router connection. To view systems logs for errors type 'logread', check service statuses with `'/etc/init.d/network status'`,
# check all the modified files. Try to reboot the NanoPi with 'reboot' and hit enter.
