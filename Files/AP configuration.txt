This is already explained on the readme file. But just in case I will put this to have a quick access if you only want to verify without returning.

Ensure the USB power suply is active:

`cat /sys/bus/usb/devices/usb3/power/control`

If returns auto, switch it to on to force the power suply on that USB port. 

`echo on > /sys/bus/usb/devices/usb3/power/control`

Force driver module reconfiguration
Remove and reload the driver module to ensure it initializes correctly:

`'rmmod rtl8812au'`
modprobe rtl8812au
Then check again to see if the Wi-Fi adapter appears: 

`lsusb`

Configure the Wi-Fi adapter manually
Try to enable the Wi-Fi interface created by the adapter:

List the available network interfaces:

`ifconfig -a`

Look for an interface similar to wlan0 or wlx.... If you find it, enable it:

`ifconfig wlan0 up`

Check if the adapter is now active:

`iw dev`

If the led on the AP goes on. Then you must modify the following files:
Go to `vi /etc/config/wireless` to set up your WiFi: (Explained on the code part)
